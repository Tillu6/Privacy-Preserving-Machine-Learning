# 🚀 Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) Framework

### 🌐 Live Demo: [PPML Framework](https://privacy-preserving-machine-learning-1.onrender.com)

## **🔒 Overview**
The **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) Framework** ensures data confidentiality while training models using advanced techniques like **Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and Homomorphic Encryption**. This project provides a secure and futuristic approach to machine learning while maintaining user data privacy. 🛡️

## **📌 Key Features**
- **🔐 Data Privacy**: Implements **Differential Privacy (DP)** and **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)** for enhanced security.
- **🤖 Federated Learning (FL)**: Enables multiple clients to train a model without sharing raw data.
- **🔄 Secure Aggregation**: Encrypts model updates before sending them to the central server.
- **🎨 Futuristic UI**: A cyberpunk-themed interface with real-time training visualizations.

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**
- **Backend**: Python 🐍, Flask, PySyft (Privacy-Preserving ML)
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch 🔥, TensorFlow, Federated Learning with Flower 🌼
- **Security & Privacy**: OpenMined PySyft, Microsoft SEAL (for Homomorphic Encryption)
- **Frontend**: React.js ⚛️ (with Three.js for cyber-graphics), Tailwind CSS 🎨
- **Deployment**: Hosted on **Render** ☁️

## **🚀 Deployment & Usage**
1. The project is live at **[PPML Framework](https://privacy-preserving-machine-learning-1.onrender.com)**
2. The UI allows users to upload encrypted datasets, monitor training progress, and visualize privacy metrics in real-time.
3. Backend services are secured using differential privacy techniques and federated learning.

## **📌 Next Steps**
- Further enhancements to **homomorphic encryption** implementation.
- Integration of **AI-powered anomaly detection** for security breaches.
- Advanced **3D visualizations** for real-time training insights.
